# Simple Chess Game

This game was an experiment to implement a chess game using [Claude AI](https://anthropic.com) and [Spck Editor](https://spck.io). Please use this as template for learning.

The prompt used in Claude Sonnet was something like:

```
Create a simple chess game, and make it look nice using tailwind css. The pieces on the board should all move according to the rules of chess and include logic for special moves like en passant and castling. The output should be in HTML and vanilla javascript.
```
